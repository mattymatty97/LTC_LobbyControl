only **the host** needs this mod installed

Lobby Control has split:
------
some of the features that are not about hosting have been moved to [Matty's Fixes](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/mattymatty/Matty_Fixes/)

Patches:
--------
- ### Steam Lobby ( all controls from terminal ):
  - allow to **re-open** the lobby while the Ship is **in Orbit** ( Late Joining )
  - **change the visibility** of the lobby  
  (public, Invite-Only, Friends-Only)
  - **rename** the lobby
- ### Vanilla Saving ( all controls from terminal ):
  - **toggle autosave** for the current SaveFile  
  ( no need to quit before Orbit to reset a run )
  - **force save** the lobby  
  ( optionally with a alternative filename backup )
  - **hotload** of the lobby  
  ( reload a previous/different savefile without having to quit the lobby )
- ### ItemLimit
  - **removed** limit on amount of items that can be saved  
  ( vanilla = 45 )
  - **removed** limit to amount of scrap that can be synchronized  
  ( vanilla = 250 )
- ### InvisibleManFix
  - **fix for late joining player being invisible if the previous owner of the body disconnected while dead**
- ### ItemSyncFix
  - prevent clients with **extra inventory** from generating unpickable items
  - fix **shotguns disappearing** if client reloads while de-synced
- ### JoinQueue:
  - process incoming connections as a queue to prevent two clients connecting at the same time
- ### LogSpam:
  - fix the causes of some spammy error messages
    - stop **CalculatePolygonPath** when enemies die
- ### Others:
  - Prevent host crashes when an extra player tries to join when the lobby is already full but the last player has not finished joining 

Terminal Command:

Differences to [ShipLobby](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/tinyhoot/ShipLobby/)
------------------------
This mod started as a Fork of ShipLobby
and instead of always reopening the lobby it allows the host to decide if and when with terminal commands

Differences to [MoreItems](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Drakorle/MoreItems/)
------------------------
MoreItems simply sets the max amount of items to the arbitrary value of 999.  
This mod instead removes the limit entirely, additionally it also allows you to sync the scrap value of all those items
