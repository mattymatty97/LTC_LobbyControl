# ShipLobby

A mod for Lethal Company which reopens the lobby whenever you're in orbit in between missions.

I've often had the issue where I'd been playing with friends for a while and one of them
decided to hop off for the night. In order to invite someone else to keep playing with
I'd have to remake the lobby every time. This mod fixes that by re-opening the lobby as soon
as you return to orbit from any mission.

**Only the host** needs to install this mod. It has no impact when used as a client. Clients who
want to join you do not need to have this mod installed.

### Differences to LateCompany

LateCompany allows joining at any point in time, even during ongoing missions. This mod
allows joining or "backfilling" *only between missions* while the ship is in orbit.
Thus, the impact of any newly joining clients is minimal and there is no danger of desynchronisation.
